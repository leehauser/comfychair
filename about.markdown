At the the dawn of 2022 I decided to start tracking my reading. I read a lot of
books each year, and I felt maybe it was time to see exactly what I was doing.

Now, in the middle of 2023, I think it's time to start talking about the books
I read. Since I read so many, and re-read many as well, I hope make these less
reviews and more discussions of how a particular book (or series of books) fit
in with other books I've read, and my view of the world.
